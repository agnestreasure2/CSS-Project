            <h3>My Love For Technology</h3>
            <p>My love for technology started as a result of curiosity, I was always curious and <br>
            anxious to know how most things came into existense, like how did someone come up with <br>
        such idea and with my like for surfing the internet, I was able to research about how most <br>
    things came to be and i discovered it was all the handwork of technology and that made me love <br>
technology and the urge to put my ideas into existense made me to venture into it and thanks to <br>
Ingressive4Good and Stutern, my love for technology is'nt just an imagination but it's coming to reality.</p>

            <h3>What I have learned so far</h3>
            <p>It has been an amazing journey and i have learnt so much from the past weeks till date, <br>
            so far, I have learnt how to structure my web page using HTML. Also, I have learnt how to style my  <br>
            Html using CSS. I learnt that Css are of three types and they are inline, internal and external Css. The <br>
            inline Css is used within the element, the internal Css is added at the head section of our Html skeleton <br>
            with the style tag while external css is added as a file and linked from the the Html file to the Css file. The <br>
            Css file is linked using the link tag which has the rel that stands as the relationship and the href which <br>
            contain the path of your Css file. Also, i learnt about the hierachy, specificity, Css selectors which are <br>
            the element selector, class and Id selector of which the Id selection is represented with # along with an id name <br>
             while the class is represented with the . along with the class name. Also i learnt about inheritance and i got to <br>
             understand that even in Css there are parents and children tag and the children get to inherit the properties of <br>
             of their parent just like in real word scenerio. So far i have learnt so much and i'm thankful because i'm able to <br>
             practicalize.

         <h4>How CSS is important</h4>
         <p>CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. As the name implies, it is important because it's used to beautify our <br>
        web page, imagine an Html code without a Css, even though Html is the structure of a web page, without a style <br>
    to beautify it, it won't be appealing to the users. So, in exence, Css is very important because it beautify your <br>
web page to your taste and to the users.</p>

            <h3>Difference between padding. margin and border</h3>
            <p>Padding is the space between an element content and an element border, that is, if a content is touching the <br>
            border but you don't want that, you can use a padding. There is padding-top, padding-left <br>
        padding-right and padding-buttom depending on where you want the space but if you want an even space <br>
    you can use padding and give it a value</p>
    <p>Margin is used to define a space around the element. Margin is the outermost layer of a border. For example <br>
    let's say we have 2 boxes but both boxes are touching each other but that's not the result you want, you want a <br>
space between the two boxes, that's where our margin comes in , you can use either margin-top or margin-buttom for <br>
either box 1 or box 2 and you will get the out come you are looking for. There is also margin-left and margin right <br>
depending on how you want to style your work and there's margin: auto; for an even margin. </p>
<p>Border is used to set border on an element. A border has different properties, they are the border_style, <br>
boder_radius and border-width which is used to size and beautify the border. An example is shown on my CSS file.</p>
